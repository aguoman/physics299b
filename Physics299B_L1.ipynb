    "Python is one of many languages you can use for research and HW purposes. In the next two lectures, we will work through many of the tool, tips, and tricks that we as graduate students (and PhD researchers) use on a daily basis. We will NOT attempt to teach you all of Python--there isn't time. We will however build up a set of code(s) that will allow you to read and write data, make beautiful publish-worthy plots, fit a line (or any function) to data, and set up algorithms. You will also begin to learn the syntax of Python and can hopefuly apply this knowledge to your current and future work. "
